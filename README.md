## React Web Developer Portfolio Website

Welcome this portfolio website! This project showcases work as a web developer and is built using React with several modern libraries to enhance its functionality, animations, and user experience.

## Project Overview

This is a simple yet dynamic portfolio website that provides a visually appealing and interactive experience for visitors. Below is a brief description of the core libraries and tools I used in this project.

## Built With

- **React:** The entire website is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** The development environment leverages Vite, a fast build tool that helps with a quicker and smoother development experience.

## Key Libraries and Their Usage

### Framer Motion

I used Framer Motion to add smooth animations and interactions to the website. It provides easy-to-use hooks for animating components, making the website feel more dynamic and engaging.

### React-Anchor-Link-Smooth-Scroll

This library helped in implementing smooth scrolling between different sections of the website. It provides an easy way to add anchor links that create a seamless navigation experience for users.

### React-Hook-Form

I utilized React-Hook-Form for the contact form to handle form state and validation in a simple, performant way. This helped ensure that form submission and validation are intuitive for both users and developers.

### Keen-Slider

Keen-Slider is used to create responsive carousels in the project. It provided an efficient and lightweight way to display slideshows of images or projects in a sleek, modern way.

## Project Structure

- **Components:** The reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, loaders, social media icons) are stored in the `components` folder.
- **Sections:** Each page section (e.g., About, Projects, Contact) is kept in the `sections` folder, making the codebase modular and easier to manage.
- **Hooks:** I used a custom hook stored in the `hooks` folder to simplify and reuse common logic.
